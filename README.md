# Photo Gallery Project

## Introduction
A Photo Gallery project I've built from scratch while using baguette.Box.js to add a Light-box functionality when viewing photos. I wanted to learn about some simple JavaScript implementation!

## Sources
baguette.Box.js - https://github.com/feimosi/baguetteBox.js

### Triumphs
I learned how to add JavaScript to a project, and use existing JavaScript developed by others to improve functionality of a page.

### Struggles
Still new to Sass, and JavaScript. There was a lot of trial and error in deciding to combine the two. However, I learned a lot even though Sass wasn't a requirement.

To exceed in the project I had to make responsive Grid and build a Search Filter function. I struggled with the JS on the filter function in that I couldn't figure out how to call it and make the HTML and JS interact.
